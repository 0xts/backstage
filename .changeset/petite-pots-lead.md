'@backstage/plugin-techdocs-react': minor

Export a new hook to share how to get the "View TechDocs" icon link properties. The function is currently used by the alpha `Techdocs` plugin and the legacy `Catalog` plugin.
This hook should only be used internally and temporarily until the legacy frontend system is deprecated.
